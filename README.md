# Online Conformance Checking & Alignment of Probabilistic Suffix Prediction: Development Repository

## Setting Up the Python Environment with Pipenv

This project uses `pipenv` on Linux devices, for managing Python dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up the virtual environment and install the necessary packages using the provided `Pipfile`.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and Pipenv installed.
1. **Install Pipenv and pyenv**:
    
    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    ```

    ```bash
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```

### Setup Instructions
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory where the `Pipfile` is located.
    
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

3. **Create the Virtual Environment**: Run the following command to create the virtual environment and install the dependencies from the `Pipfile`:
    
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Once the environment is set up, activate it with:
    
    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```

5. **Run the Project**: You can now run the project within the virtual environment. Execute a Juyter notebook.
